# bls : Balanced Latin Squares

A Latin square[1] is an *n x n* array filled with *n* different symbols, each occuring exactly once in each row and column.

Latin squares are often used in experiment designs; each row corresponds to a participant, and each column corresponds to a condition.
In order to control for the ordering of the conditions, experiments can use a Balanced Latin Square[2].

When the number of conditions is even, each condition will precede another once.
When the number of conditions is odd, each condition will precede another twice.
